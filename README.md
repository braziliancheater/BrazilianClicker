# brazilianClicker

Alright so this is one of my first autoclickers made way back on 2017~2018, i found it today while cleaning my old hdd so i decided to release it here as i dont have any reasons to keep it private anymore.<br/>
at the time this used empty's base so this is just a remade of that.
back then i decided to add new things to the code, and improvements on what i think needed it at the time.

## OK then! with that out of the way what's new?

1. shitty AntiDump() basically closes any debuger window, got the idea from csgo loaders.
2. xor on strings!
3. made the code a bit more readable and added some extra files.
4. a checker to see if Minecraft is open
5. made it look cooler! :sunglasses: and added a few new infomation for the final user!
6. a random name each time you open the clicker
7. select any delay between clicks
8. commented all the code so newbies can understand what is going on.
 
do i plan on updating this? **no**.<br/>
if you are looking for any maintained projects check the NEW [empty-clicker](https://github.com/martin3lli/emptyclicker) or [clicker](https://github.com/b1scoito/clicker)

## how to install it?

in order to start coding just download the repo using the green button up there and open fr.sln <br/>

you obviously need vs2019 or smt like that <br/>
if you have any problems google it 

you will probaly need this too - https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

i probaly made a compiled version of this too so you dont need to fix the code. check Releases

## thanks

use this on a way to learn new stuff and to code your own autoclicker or client! you can do much more with this base and not just skid
enjoy!

and finally thanks to [latencyX](https://github.com/martin3lli) for the base and some of the methods and variables that are still implemented on this<br/>
and to Xr for helping me when i was a dumb cunt!

## dislamer

You CANNOT use this code to make any paid application.<br/>
the autoclicker is also pretty bad so i dont recomend using this, unless you fix the clicking methods or smt. it may be safe to use on no anticheat servers like hypixel or mushmc <br/>
if any of the guys that i skidded code wants me to remove it please contact me on discord brazilian#0047.
