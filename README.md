# brazilianClicker

Alright so this is one of my first autoclickers made way back on 201something, i found it today while cleaning my old hdd so i decided to release it here as i dont have any reasons to keep it private.<br/>

## OK then! tf does it have?

1. shitty AntiDump() basically closes any debuger window, got the idea from csgo loaders.
2. xor
3. made the code a bit more readable and added some extra files.
4. a checker to see if Minecraft is open
5. made it look cooler! :sunglasses: and added a few new infomation for the final user!
6. a random name each time you open the clicker
7. select any delay between clicks
8. commented all the code so newbies can understand what is going on.
 
do i plan on updating this? **no**.<br/>
if you are looking for any maintained projects check [empty-clicker](https://github.com/martin3lli/emptyclicker) or [clicker](https://github.com/b1scoito/clicker)

you obviously need vs2019 or smt like that <br/>
if you have any problems google it 

you will probaly need this too - https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

i probaly made a compiled version of this too so you dont need to fix the code. check Releases

## thanks

to stackoverflow for 60% of this
to [latencyX](https://github.com/martin3lli) for some of the code

## dislamer

You CANNOT use this code to make any paid application.<br/>
the autoclicker is also pretty bad so i dont recomend using this, unless you fix it or smt. it may be safe to use on no anticheat servers like hypixel or mushmc <br/>
if any of the guys that i skidded code wants me to remove it please contact me.
